# StationeersBepInEx.FixModLoading
A BepInEx plugin for Stationeers beta that reimplements loading of mods.

**NOTE:** Local mods in Beta require the `About.xml` to be directly in the mod folder and in the `About/` directory; local mods do not load or appear in the mod list GUI if the `About.xml` and `About/About.xml` cannot be found.
